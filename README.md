Retry Mechanism – Automatically retries failed requests with fallback logic to improve reliability.

JWT Security – Implements JSON Web Token–based authentication and authorization to secure all APIs.

RESTful APIs – Cleanly designed endpoints for creating, viewing, and managing hotel ratings.

Spring Cloud Integration – Built to work seamlessly in a microservice ecosystem.
